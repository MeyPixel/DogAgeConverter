# DogAgeConverter
JS function which converts human age into dog age
This is my first JavaScript project, which is quite simple: a dog age converter, which is composed by an HTML file which is a form that asks you for your age
and the function attached calculates the age multiplying it by seven, which is the current formula used for converting a human's age into a dog's age in years.
